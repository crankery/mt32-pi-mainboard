# mt32-pi-mainboard

A host board for the [mt32-pi project](https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi). I've tried to use nothing but through-hole cheap parts off Aliexpress for this. I had one of the LCD2004 modules in a drawer which is why I used that huge thing. The board is 100x100mm which should be pretty cheap to get fabricated.
